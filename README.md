CONCLUSION:-

Here a comparison of Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression model is
performed where the score of the model R2 tends to be 0.99 and 1.0 which indicates a
strong prediction model to forecast the next coming days active cases. Using the
Multiple Linear Regression model as on September month, the forecast value of
52,290 active cases are predicted towards the next month of 15th October in India and
9,358 active cases in Odisha if situation continues like this way.
At the end of the our Project,we are trying to compare the best accurrate result
predicted by these two models.
